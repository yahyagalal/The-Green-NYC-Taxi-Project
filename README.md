# The-Green-NYC-Taxi-Project
NYC's Green Taxi Data: Using Pandas, I cleaned and structured raw data. Docker containerized the process for easy deployment. PySpark enhanced cleaning for larger datasets. Airflow orchestrated the workflow seamlessly. This project blends traditional and big data tools to unlock insights from NYC's taxi landscape
